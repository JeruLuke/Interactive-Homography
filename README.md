# Interactive-Homography
Sometimes theremight be a need to engrave one image into another. Homography can help you achieve that. This easy-to-understand repo has an implementation using OpenCV to choose where you want to engrave an image at a location of your choice.

To know more about Homography visit the [blog post by Satya Mallick](https://www.learnopencv.com/homography-examples-using-opencv-python-c/). It is written in a way easy to understand along with code examples in Python and C++. Towards the end of the post he mentions the steps to make a virtual billboard. This is what I am about to demonstrate here. 

I have an image of a street in New York (the image in the blog) and would like to place an image having the cast of Spartacus (TV series) on one of their billboards.

Here are the images used:

1. The street of New York city:
